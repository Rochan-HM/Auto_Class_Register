# Auto_Class_Register
A script to automatically register you to your classes!

# Note
1. Only works on Windows for now
2. Needs Google Chrome

P.S: Your credentials are safe! They are not being sent anywhere! The script runs locally :)))

# Usage
1. Download the executable and the provided two images and put them in a folder (or clone this repo).
2. Run the executable approximately 5 - 10 minutes before your registration time (It might take some time to load initially depending on your PC).

Note: If the application doesn't seem to work, try running it as Administrator.

Enjoy!
